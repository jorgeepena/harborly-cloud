            <h4>Enhance your brand recognition and Customer experiencie</h4>
            <p>When customers choose to work with your studio or yourself, they have high expectations. Customers want positive interactions with each team member every step of the way. They want to feel like you care about their experience and are taking proactive steps to make it as smooth as possible.</p>
            <p>When you send a link to a new tool where they need to create a new account, where they have to re-learn every process and adapt to your needs you fail at crafting a life-long client.</p>

            <h5>Built by Creatives, for Creatives</h5>
            <p>We know the challenges of design work firsthand; for the last 12 years we’ve delivered countless web design projects. In this time we experienced the biggest problem in any creative endeavor:</p>
            <p><strong>Projects get stuck. Constantly.</strong></p>
            <p>To solve this problem we built this software that allows teams and clients to have always the correct information to keep on going on time and on budget while delivering a great Customer Experience that boosts your brand.</p>

            <h6>Why we built Harborly</h6>
            <p><strong>Harborly is the solution to our headaches.</strong></p>
            <p>In all the years we’ve run our client-focused agencies and design service companies we exprienced time and time again an important challenge: collecting the onboarding information our team needed from clients when they needed it.</p>
            <p>The project management tools we tried were ineffective (and trusts us, we've used Monday, ClickUp, Microsoft Suite with Teams and Sharepoint, JIRA... omg); even when having a small team having the files at hand and on time was complicated and for our clients a burdersome experience from configuring the tool in their computers and learning them.</p>
            <p>With Harborly we’ve solved all this problems by enabling small studios, web designers and freelancers to automate collection of files and forms, to have a better control for their client requests and boosting their brand with an easy-to-use, white-label client portal that can be embeded in their own domain.</p>
